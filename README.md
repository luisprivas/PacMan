## Description

This project consists of an interactive "game" where you can create various Pacman figures that move across the screen and bouce off walls. 

## How to run

- Click the green "code" button
- Click "Download ZIP" on the dropdown menu
- Unzip the files
- Open index.html on a web broser
- Everytime you click the "New Pacman" button a new PacMan will appear on the screen.
- Click the "Start Game" button once you are ready to start the game.
- You can keep clicking "New Pacman" to add more PacMan.

## Roadmap

I will be adding CSS styles to the buttons and a PacMan counter.
